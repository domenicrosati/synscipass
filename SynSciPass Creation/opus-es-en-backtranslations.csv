"However, the transport of material along the r-axis is not significant and the stars can still form within the walls of the cavity (see fig.models with the fall of gas reveal that in case of a supersonic fall a shock wave spreads towards the center of the galaxy and triggers a very powerful central star drop.a subsonic provides instead a continuous gas reservoir for sf and does not trigger star bursts. also in this case, the sf lasts several hundred of myr.of our models we find that tdgs are not necessarily destroyed quickly and can sustain sf for more than 200 yr and that galactic winds do not always suppress sf."
"work in that direction is in progress.it is a pleasure to thank a.-s. tremblay, j.- l.richard and s. pariault for the enlightening discussions and key ideas.we are indebted to yuri vilk for providing us with its code that allows calculations in 2d, and steve Allen to share their calculation results of mount carlo.in this appendix we detail the calculations of the double occupancy factor for the problem of 2d, isotropic and anisotropic site 3d, and @xmath0 results, presented in the main text, and the observation that, when scaled properly, @xmath178 does not depend on the dimension in high @xmath121, we expect a good quantitative agreement between the problem of 2d, isotropic and anisotropic site and the results of infinite latice for any dimension at high temperature."

"However, we have grouped over the data between two eyes because there was little difference. therefore, the thresholds were calculated by taking the mean of the blinking delay into twelve ascending reverses. Figure 2 shows the main result, the precision for the time synchronization quantified in terms of time phase for a range of different time frequencies. individual and group average results are shown. to two - way anovate with factors of time frequency and equicentricity revealed a significant main effect of time frequency, f(3, 6 ) = 16,6, p = 0.003, indicating that as the time frequency increased, the accuracy to detect the time synchronization in terms of time phase increased. the linear adjustment to the data with an interception of zero x is consistent with a simple linear model that incorporates a time delay that can describe the results through the time frequency. i.e., delay in millisecond between peaks of sinusoid fluctuation was almost constant between different time frequencies."

"therefore the function husimi can be considered as a probability distribution in the phase space, and its order of offshoring can be a measure of chaotic quantum states. in that sense, the classical entropy of Wehrl seems to be a good candidate measure. however, the entropy of Wehrl is defined as an integral over the phase space, and is not easy to calculate numerically. to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no calculation for a system more than one - dimensional.( a calculation for a one-dimensional system - time - driven by @xcite. )"
"The program simulates the transport of ions through the materials of the sub-detectors of ams.the digitization of the signals is simulated according to the measured characteristics and the response of the electronics.The use of mount carlo in this analysis is limited to the estimation of the geometric acceptances, the evaluation of the function of the response of the tracker, and the top - of - the correction of the instrument.data collected in the first 60 months of operation of ams, corresponding to a time of collection of @xmath8 s, have been analyzed, using only the seconds during which the detector was in normal operating conditions, ams pointed within @xmath9 of the local zenit, and the iss was outside of the southern Atlantic anomaly.downloaded particles 5 and 6 in the internal tracker and utof are first selected.the efficiency of this selection is very high, up to 98% of negligible probability of load."
"The formation of the nearest binaries, in particular, may differ significantly from the formation of individual stars or stars in wide binaries ( *?? * and references in them).For example, highly variable accretion rates are frequently associated with the presence of a close companion, and the observations of jet - as outputs (herbig stars - haro and fu orionis ) have been linked to the episodic accretion caused by tidal interactions between proto - stars and their disks in nearby binaries @xcite.a radically different circumstellar environment between individual stars and stars in nearby binaries.If these different accretion processes also lead to different depositions of extended cs discs, while nearby binary stars can increase through different processes such as accretion flows @xcite.si these different processes of accretions in the proto downtable environment in the most advanced populations of stars, they should not gradually disappear in the earlier phase of stars."

"[ fig:4 ] with the secret rate in fig.[ fig:3 ] obtained in the absence of peak limitations, we observe that not having the information from the roasting channel results in a certain loss in the secret rate. we also see that the performance of the on/off control scheme is very close to the optimal secret capability (when only the main channel and the primary channel csi is available ) for a wide range of snrs, and approaching the optimal rate when snr is high. note that the optimality of the high snrs on/off control scheme has been demonstrated in @xcite for the secret fade channel.thus, the on/off control method has great utility in practical systems due to its advantage of simple implementation. in this article, we have considered a spectrum system - share subject to security considerations and studied the optimal energy allocation strategies for the secret under average fade channel and peak received power restrictions in the primary user. in particular, we have considered two scenarios in relation to the availability of csi."

"He illustrated this idea from the experience of health equity interventions carried out in a developing country situation: that of Namibia. Finally, we discussed the implications for developing countries of moving from a health development approach in service delivery to one based on addressing disparities in health status. We suggest that there are reasons to be cautious about focusing on the last step in our sequence of health equity goals and that for many developing countries it can represent a step too far. The health equity objectives listed in column 1 of Table 1 are generally postulated as mutually exclusive and there are differences of opinion as to which is preferable. Some argue that Goal 5 should be considered fundamental, with others as instrumental in achieving the fundamental objective (a williams, personal communication, February 2002)."

"A large body of work supports the proposal that egg transplantation in various models of spinal cord injury and demyelinization may promote axonal regeneration, remyelinization and functional recovery [ 212 ]. However, some researchers have questioned whether transplanted eggs form peripheral myelin, or whether they recruit endogenous scs that form myelin [ 13, 14 ].These events are not mutually exclusive in that transplanted ova can facilitate both the invasion of the spinal cord and myelin axon.It is important to note that Franklin and Al. demonstrated myelin in the spinal cord by an oec cell line, strongly suggesting that ova can effectively remyelinate axons. Although ova do not form myelin on fine-caliberated olfactory fibers during normal development, numerous studies have shown that ovules can repair cells omielan cells, omielate cells, omienate cells, omienate cells, 2, in a variety of dissolution models."
"Part task trainers consist of 3-d representations of body parts/regions with functional anatomy for the teaching and evaluation of particular skills, such as plastic arms for venopuncture or suture. In most cases, the user interface is passive (i.e., the device is examined, or procedures are performed on it, with little more than rudimentary responses of the simulator ).Although more sophisticated task trainers may contain computer components, however we distinguish them from the computer - improved mannequins (cems ) because the latter reproduce not only anatomy, but also normal and physiopathological functions. with cems."

"Genetic algorithms consist of a class of bioinspired algorithms that originated in the studies of j. holland in the 1970s @xcite.the metaphor underlying this method is that of natural evolution, whose concepts are followed in a very simple scheme that allows computers to evolve automatic solutions over time.The method is constructed on the basis of the evolution of populations using processes analogous to biological ones, namely, mutation and crossing (variation, selection, and inheritance).Genetic algorithms are very effective to obtain good solutions from `` scratch'', but they are less efficient to improve on good ones.The reasons are the same as in real biology.Since the available genetic space begins to show small variations, the mechanisms of evolution (in special selection) are no longer very effective and new solutions must depend to a large extent on mutations, which are generally effective only for long periods of time.Although there are some computational tricks to overcome these difficulties and improve the performance of the algorithm, sometimes they are very difficult to implement numerically."
The activation signal initiates the reading sequence simultaneously on each of the eight repeater cards.analog delay is added to the firing signal to achieve an optimal time for collecting the load on the detectors.The activation system is protected against events that are very close to each other by vetoing any additional firing signal that should occur while the repeater cards are busy reading the latest event.dead time to read an event using a 6-mhz clock on the repeater cards and taking into account cable delays is 172 @xmath0s.The reading of the detectors is controlled from the counting room using the standard technology commercially available vme - based on.a commercial 8-channel vme adc sis3300 with 12-bit resolution is used to digitize analog signals from the repeater cards.

"An unfortunate side effect of the rapid availability of small, cheap, low-power light sources, in a disconcerting range of colors, means that it is now virtually impossible to obtain electronic equipment without state indicator lights. ensuring that such lighting is diverted, deactivated or otherwise extinguished has required considerable effort. boundary and proximity switches are pointed out as the worst offenders. it is also required that all optical encoders are deactivated, all motorized actuators coded from - energized and all state indicators of pneumatic valves are properly sealed during observations. that this is essential is made clear when one realizes that these systems are no longer just inside the dome but actually within a spectrum! it has been designed from the beginning with this in mind, but one consequence of the suppression of excellent light, and high sensitivity, is that every light leak must finally be tracked down and eliminated. at intervals during their working life of the friendal fibers, which can be improved at a level of fiber."

These findings from this discriminant analysis suggest that from biomarkers tested in this study, leukocyte counts, mpo, and papp - to us have the greatest potential as biomarkers of acute cardiovascular disease and could be suitable candidates to be included in the multimarker approach' to assess cardiovascular risk. Future studies should evaluate the predictive value of this multimarker approach for cardiovascular events. In addition, we want to emphasize that the clinical application of a multimarker approach depends not only on using the most promising biomarkers, but also on the relationship between costs and benefits. Therefore, this should also be taken into account in future studies. In conclusion, leukocyte counts and fibrinogen, crp, myeloperoxidase, and plasma protein associated with pregnancy."

"We have applied the quantum path method to the two-level atom system strongly driven by a coherent light field and disturbed by stochastic noise.We have developed a new method to obtain the resonance fluorescence spectrum of numerical simulations.This method is especially advantageous for physical systems where noise dominates dynamics, and it is necessary to simulate many quantum trajectories using small steps of time.The simulation of a single quantum trajectory revealed that for a high magnitude of noise the phase difference between the dressed states tends to stabilize around fixed values.When calculating the spectrum of resonance fluorescence, narrow resonances such as central dip and dispersive fano - as profile occurred in the regime where noise dominated the rabi oscillations.These modifications of the resonance fluorescence spectra are associated with the stabilization of the dressed and stochastically induced quantum interference phases between various emission channels.This work was supported by the hungary research fund under contract No.t034484 and by the polish committee for scientific research (2po3b 015 )."

"Cytosolic ca ion concentration is maintained at low concentration compared to extracellular ca ions. The concentration gradient ca determines the activity of many enzymes, through activation or inactivation of enzymes such as phospholipases, atpasses, proteases, and endonucleases. The increase in intracellular ca levels induces apoptotic cell death [ 17 - 19 ]. During ischemia, intracellular ca ca overloads and activates multiple molecular cascades, which contribute to eventual cell death. Although cell injury results from increased ca ion concentration, and this in turn mediates the cascades of irreversible cell death, loss of calcium homeostasis is not always an ascending event."

"However, in order for the brightness of the boundary layer to be irradiated into the star and then reradiated from the star surface it would require that the optical depth along this indirect path be less than the vertical optical depth of the boundary layer itself.This is not the case, for the simple reason that below the boundary layer, the accretion material must be supported by the pressure gradient, so that the pressure and density of the accretion gas increases rapidly with the decreasing radius.By contrast, the density is low immediately outside the boundary layer due to the high radial velocity of the accretion material.As a result, the vertical optical depth of the accretion material is smaller just outside the boundary layer, and increases rapidly as the material flows inwards and installs into the star.This leads to the natural conclusion that the boundary layer luminosity radiates radially to the outside rather than inward, and is emitted directly from the boundary layer surface and the inner disk (the `` thermal boundary layer'), instead of the star surface."

"It was demonstrated before the proper hybridization of the deeply eroded dentin surface seemed difficult, as confirmed by the significantly reduced binding resistance measured after a year of water storage.The thickest layer of collagen exposed by erosion could hardly be infiltrated by the adhesive.This should probably be attributed to the collapse of demineralized collagen fibrills and their higher water content that prevented the adhesive from fully infiltrated, but probably also polymerized properly. Such hybridization inefficiency increased nanofiltration and, consequently, accelerated bond degradation [23, 24].This is further supported by the most prominent micro-species failure within the hybrid layer after a year of water storage, as observed in the semen after the bond resistance tests, and by improved silver deposition, as for example by the most prominent micro-species failure within the hybrid layer."

"However, both patients treated with apc showed recurrence21 as in the above-mentioned research studies, this study maintains that apc appears to be less effective.However, in other studies using apc as initial treatment, only 10% showed recurrence and many showed favorable results.This is more likely when treated by a well-trained and experienced endoscopy expert22, therefore, in patients at high risk for endoscopic resection or surgery, rescue treatment with apc is believed to be the optional treatment.Some reports have observed that positive margin cancer does not show recurrence with surgery or observation15,19,20 therefore, close observation of recurrence may be another alternative for treatment.Endoscopic resection by emr/ed is an important treatment method for example. due to the increasing incidence of endoscopic resection, endoscopic resection rates have increased and there are many ongoing studies on expanded indications, therefore it is important to decide on the range of curative resection in the field of resection in endoscopic resection."
"The selection criteria for prostatic cystectomy - sparing performed by a committee of experts or the uses of validated questionnaires to evaluate the functional results can solve this problem.There were few patients included and patients have a short follow-up ; however, it is one of the few results that describe laparoscopic radical cystectomy with the reduction of the prostatic capsule.Most of the largest series published describes open procedures, and it is well known that the laparoscopic approach to radical cystectomy has shown significant improvements in intraoperative blood loss and length of stay without a significant increase in complications [16, 17, 18]. We believe that the good view of the pelvis in the trendelenburg position leads us to the ability to perform a good hemostasis within the prostatic capsule with bipolar instruments of gripping. from the oncological point of view, more time is needed to compare the results with the open procedure, but early oncological results are comparable with the open surgery series with bi-poco instruments."

"The presence of crystalline water ice has been widely reported for many bodies of the outer solar system, such as the satellites of the main planets, charon and more recently quaoar. As noted by @xcite para ( 50000 ) quaoar, the presence of crystalline water ice is considered problematic in the kuiper belt because, in general, the lower-energy amorphous ice is favored in cold environments. Crystalline water ice may have prevailed in the early solar nebula and may have been incorporated into bodies at low temperatures ( @xmath48 k ) if the flow of deposition of water molecules was low. However, the disruptive action of cosmic rays and the bombardment of solar flow on the outer surfaces of the ice bodies is expected to reorder the crystalline to morphic ice in the outer solar system @xcite. both the solar flow and the bombardment of cosmic rays can cause extensive radiation damage to the outer layers of kbos."

"1998 ) have shown that the peak power spectrum of galaxies and clusters, and the respective angular power spectrum of the microwave cosmic background temperature anisotropy ( cmb ) radiation are barely compatible with the standard scale - free primordial power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ).An agreement is possible only for extreme values for cosmological parameters (Hubble constant and barionic fraction of matter ) that are almost outside the limits of the range allowed by other data. motivated by the difficulty of reconciling the observed power spectra with cdm-type models - we try to calculate the primary power spectrum of matter empirically. We will use the latest determinations of the power spectra for various populations of galaxies and clusters of galaxies reduced in amplitude to the spectrum of matter power in the local universe ( einast and al. 1999a, 1999b, below documents i and ii, respectively )."

"Interestingly, the simultaneous blocking of both receptors had an additive effect on the inhibition of efferocytosis.These results suggest that the molecules present in the ac membrane affect both receptors, and that this is necessary for the ingestion of ac.plus, we were able to demonstrate by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy that efferocytosis caused an increase in cd36 and papr.since the samples were not permeabilized, we can conclude that the overlap of cd36 and papr occurs in the cell membrane.However, the possibility of interactions between the receptors in the phagosmic membrane after ingestion of apoptotic cells or even in cytoplasmic compartments cannot be ruled out.The dynamics and traffic of membrane receptors involve the formation of lipid (lr ), which are cholesterol- and sphingomyel - membrane-rich microdomens that function as platforms to promote the association of signaling molecules and the compartmentation of cellular processes."

"Interestingly, there seems to be a high degree of overlap between working memory for musical stimuli and for verbal stimuli, as demonstrated in recent work-memory experiments.This could be one of the reasons why musicians tend to show a slightly superior verbal work memory at least in tonal languages such as Chinese.. it was found that in musicians, compared to non-musicians, there is more gray matter in the part of the frontal cortex known to accommodate neural networks that are involved in several important processes of working memory. one might thus conclude that a kind of positive transfer between musical performance and verbal memory functions takes place ; in other words, that the music learning process improves learning verbal tasks (see box 1 for definitions of technical terms used in this article ).Although auditory music is closely associated with strong emotional feelings, and although music activates the entire limbic system, which is involved in the processing of emotions and in memory control [ 11 - 14 ]."

"i.e. a predominant metabolism through a non-enzymatic pathway, rabeprazole is less susceptible to the influence of genetic polymorphisms for cyp2c19 (which encodes a member of the cytochrome superfamily p450 ), resulting in minor influences on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ( 23 ).a recently meta fact - analysis concluded that the efficacy of the first - triple therapies based on omeprazole and lansoprazole at standard doses depends on cyp2c19 genotype state, which appears not to affect the efficacy of regimens including rabeprazole ( 24 ).amoxycilline is unstable at low ph, but its half-life is still 15 hours at a ph of 2. in contrast, clarithromycin is particularly sensitive to acid degradation and has a half-life of less than 1 hour based on pp 2 ( 25 ), the péxical effect is especially of."
The map of the human genome ( table 1 ) provides the highest resolution human mapping data available and is likely to do so until the full human genome is published.The overlaps between clones are calculated using the fpc program ( table 1 ) based on patterns of clone restriction fragments or fingerprints.

"Once a type of collider and a supersymmetric model is specified, the event generator program can produce a complete simulation of the types of scatter events expected.The final state of any simulated scatter event is composed of a list of electrons, muons, photons and long-lived hadrons (pions, kaons, nucleons etc.) and their associated 4-vectors that can be measured in a colliding experiment.The underlying idea of susy event generator programs is that for a specific collider type ( @xmath25, @xmath8, @xmath32, @xmath33 ) and the mass energy center, the event generator, for any set of model parameters, will generate several events of particle pair production in the relationship of its cross production sections, and with distributions given by its differential cross sections.more, the spparticles produced will experience a (possibly multiple - cascade ) of disintegration @cita in a final model, depending on the fixed state."
"Non-adherence to medicines among diabetic patients resulted in poor blood glucose control and therefore an increased risk of developing chronic complications, as well as an increase in hospitalization and mortality.However, there is no gold standard for this assessment, although several methods have been reported in the literature.Recently, the global health organization stated that only 50% of patients diagnosed with chronic disease were fully compatible with their treatment regimen, in developing countries the rate is even lower."
