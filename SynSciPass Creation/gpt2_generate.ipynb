      " For more information on this topic, see DMU Basics.There are five elements within directional distance and three functions. The Directional Distance FunctionAn Example of Directional Distance FunctionA two dimensional vector is represented by a vector of length two, where two contains all of the individual points. The following diagram illustrates how a two dimensional vector is represented by this five-dimensional Vector of Length Two.The first thing to notice is that our two dimensional vector is not an ideal representation of our 2D vector. What we have before us is a vector of length two, and this is actually an approximation of the vector of length four. You don't get the full four dimensional result that you would if you added the dimension of the first component to the second component.In terms of a two dimensional vector, we have some properties like the direction, the magnitude, the direction of acceleration, and the magnitude, the angle of the acceleration. We can say that we have a vector. And a vector contains a couple of points. They also contain one component which contains the direction of vector. Now, if I think of the first component of a two dimensional vector in terms of these two points, i.e. one point, the second point is a point that exists within the same space, but it exists within a different location! In this sense, the second component is a displacement â€“ a displacement from what was previously a point. The same should work for the first component of a two dimensional vector if I use the same idea as outlined above. And this explains why it is called the first component of a vector and the second component of a vector. Another interesting thing to note is that I can also write a non-local vector as two components. You will remember the image above where I had given each component of two vectors one point. This is how you can write a vector in two dimensions. In this case, my non-local vector is a two point vector and my first component is another pair of vectors. The non-local vector is then called a unit vector.The name also implies that this coordinate system is symmetrical, which it is. The axis of symmetry is the y-axis, which I have denoted z. If you want to think of the vectors z, w and x, this is the coordinate system that you want to represent them as. In this case, I have just given you a coordinate system, and for our purposes, we need to think of it as a reference system.With these different systems of coordinate systems, now we need to figure out which one we are comfortable with. The answer is fairly simple: when you choose a coordinate system, you are choosing to view a certain space as an extended metric space, and the only difference is the choice of reference. If we were to look at some point that is a million kilometers from the observer, and our metric system is set up in such a way that we can relate our point with what is the closest object to us (such that the shortest distance between those entities would be a million kilometers for\n"
