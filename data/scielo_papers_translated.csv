Mapping the spatial relationships, processes or structures of a given territory –based on information from different primary and secondary sources and even from descriptions of the city recorded in various texts, historical and geographical documents– and producing an overview, is a way of knowing. Indeed, in the scenario of maps, there is not only the ability to represent the entire space in a given period of time, but also to observe the space of specific configurations that are recorded in that urban and territorial system. In this line of argument, cartographic documentation works, as the academic José Ignacio González has said, ""whatever their scale or type, must comply with various processes of analysis and synthesis, regulated by a series of stages that begin with the collection of information, processing of the same and elaboration of the product.",1

A type of knowledge emerges from mapping spatial relationships, processes and structures of a determined territory; from information offered by a variety of primary and secondary sources, and even descriptions of the city from different texts, historic papers and geographical documents; and from producing a complete vision of the whole.1 In fact, in the realm of maps, it is not only possible to represent an entire area over a specific time span, but also to observe in that space specific configurations that are registered in that urban and territorial system. Along this line of argument, works of cartographic documentation, as the academic Jose Ignacio Gonzalez has said, ""whatever their scale or type should comply with a variety of analysis and synthesis processes, regulated by a series of stages that begin with the compilation and processing of information and the elaboration of the product.",0

MALT lymphomas are followed by diffuse large B cell lymphomas which account for 60% of gastric lymphomas. These may be secondary to the transformation of a marginal zone lymphoma or they may recur. Mantle cell lymphoma or lymphomatous polyposis accounts for up to 30% of primary GI tract lymphomas. Its presentation is different from the previously described lymphomas since it is usually multifocal. Follicular B lymphomas, Burkitt lymphomas, T cell lymphomas associated with enteropathy, and monomorphic CD56+ intestinal lymphomas are much less frequent. Hodgkins lymphoma in the GI tract is very unusual 1-5. Nodal follicular lymphoma FL is one of the most frequent types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL. Most cases of FL are initially detected in the lymph nodes. Visceral compromise is secondary to dissemination from compromised nodal groups.
